          <li><b>Responsibilities:</b> Member of the core team. ● Implement new features and fix production bugs. ● I helped with decisions in the architecture and software design of the app. We needed to provide a customizable SDK in order to provide doctor’s video calls support to third party apps. The app needed to supports multiple skins, we used flavors to accomplish that. ● When RxJava1 was deprecated I suggested to migrate all our whole project to RxJava2 and I offered myself to do that. This was challenging since RxJava used to support nulls in the stream but RxJava2 doesn’t. ● Since I have been writing Kotlin since 2015(I started with it for fun) I evaluated the use of Koltin in our project and migrate all our service(networking) layer to Kotlin. Now our codebase is 37% Kotlin and increasing.</li>

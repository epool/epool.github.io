    title: Career Profile
    text: 'I am a Software Engineer graduated from the Facultad de Matemáticas de la Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán. I like to learn and implement projects with new technologies, also I like the Software Architecture and Software Design. During the last two years of my professional career I had the opportunity to work at <b>Aluxoft</b>, a startup located in Merida, Yucatan; it is mainly dedicated to develop iOS mobile apps. I started working as web developer and months later I was promoted to iOS developer where I developed the mobile version of another startup called <i>“PikHub”</i>. This startup was a social network to share photos in real time from iOS devices. I also worked on an iPhone app for face detection using the Open CV library (this library detects the faces). I also worked on another startup called <b>Inuup</b>, where I did similar activities as in <b>Aluxoft</b>. I graduated from college in 2012, then I moved to Monterrey in order to work in <b>NIC México</b>, a company dedicated to the administration of the <i>.mx</i> domain names and also to selling these domain names. I worked during my first months as an <i>Information Systems Developer</i> in the area dedicated to business projects, working as backend(Java) and frontend developer. Some time later I was promoted to the area dedicated to the operation of the business systems, also as a <i>System Developer</i>. In this area I used to develop new features in the systems that <b>NIC México</b> offers to its customers (which are thousands of customers), and also I used to fix any bug that these systems may had. These systems from the business unit known as <i>Akky</i>. Then I started working at <b>Kuona</b> an application for groceries smart shoping list back then, I migrated the Android phonegap app to Android native. Once I leave <b>Kuona</b> I started working at <b>Nearsoft</b> an consulting company with American clients, and I was assinged with the MDLive client where I helped to build the v4.0 of the app from scratch.
My main goal is to contribute with my knowledge and skills in the area of ​​software engineering. In order to achieve this goal, I like to use my self initiative to gain new knowledge at every opportunity that is show up, and also I like to use the best practices in developing quality software to improve the company.
